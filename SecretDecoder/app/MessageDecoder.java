/**
 * Decodes messages that have been encoded in the following way:
 * 
 * 1. All h's not at the beginning of the word became Xâ€™s.
 * 
 * 2. All two adjacent vowels were surrounded by v's. e.g. either became
 * veivther
 * 
 * 3. Lowercase vowels shifted over: a became e, e became i, i became o, o
 * became u, u became a.
 * 
 * 4. Every 3-letter combination with an s in the middle was surrounded by f and
 * r. E.g. asp became faspr
 * 
 * 5. Commas replaced spaces and spaces replaced commas. E.g. this i know became
 * this,i,know
 * 
 * 6. Inserted y as second letter of each word.
