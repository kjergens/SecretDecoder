<h1>Secret Decoder</h1>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Strings, Regular Expressions</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
Donâ€™t let your messages be understood by hackers! There is a file in this project secret_messages.txt. It contains messages that have been encoded in the following ways, in this order:</p>

<ol>
<li>All two adjacent vowels were surrounded by v's. e.g. "either" became "veivther"</li>

<li>Lowercase vowels shifted over: a became e, e became i, i became o, o became u, u became a.</li>

<li>Every 3-letter combination with an s in the middle was surrounded by f and r. E.g. "asp" became "faspr"</li>

<li>Commas replaced spaces and spaces replaced commas. E.g. "this i know" became "this,i,know"</li>

<li>Every occurrance of "nn" became "Xd".</li>

<li>"yy" was appended to the end of every word.</li>
</ol>

<p>Write a Java program to decode the secret messages. Hint: Use the <a href="RegularExpressions.pdf">Regular Expressions cheat sheet</a>.</p>




<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h3>Base Assignment (12 points)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Git clone the starter code: https://github.com/daltonschool/SecretDecoder.git
(Eclipse > Import... > Git > Project from Git > Clone URI)</li>

<li>Open MessageDecoder.java.</li>

<li>Run it. See it prints the messages from secret_messages.txt.</li>

<li>Your job is to decode the messages before it prints them.</li>
</ol>
<h3> Initiative (5 points)</h3>
<p>
You can also encode images! The images in this project were encoded by a program that switched all the x,y coordinates, e.g. 0.646,2.49 became 2.49,0.646. </p>
<ol>
<li>Open the secret images included in this project. (Control-click on secret_image1.svg, Open With, Other..., Internal Web Browser, select the 2 check boxes, select OK. Now all the images will open in a new tab.)</li>

<li>Run ImageDecoder.java.

<li>Open the decoded images. (At first they will look the same as the original.)</li>

<li>Your job is to write code to switch all the x,y coordinates back.</li>

<li>If you succeed, the decoded images will go back to their original form.</li>

<p>Hint: This initiative can be done with one line of code.</p>
</ol>

<h2>Grading Guide:</h2>
  
 72 pts for on time.
  
 12 pts for base assignment (2 pts for each decoding rule).
  
 3 pts for documentation including name!
  
 3 pts for style
  
 5 pts for also decoding the images
